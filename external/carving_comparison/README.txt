This folder contains the carved output that is generated by the following
carving tools:

1. Adroit Photo Forensics (Proprietary carving tool)
2. Scalpel (Open source)

The carved output from these two carving tools is used for evaluating the 
proposed carving method i.e The number of valid JPEG files will be compared
with each other. The more valid carved JPEG files, the more robust the file carving tool.
