Description

Important: The output generataed by APF includes images of different file types.
For this reason, the generated output can be subdivided in the following folders:

1. JPEG
2. GIF
3. PNG
4. Others

The carved file types can then be classified in different categories such as:

1. Recovery Type
   1.1 Embedded in Carved:       contains carved images that were embedded in other files
   1.2 Invalid-Partially Carved: contains carved images that were not fully recovered
   1.3 Sequentially Carved:      contains carved images that were sequentially recovered
   1.4 Smart Carved:             contains carved images that were stored fragmented and smartly recovered
   1.5 Active:                   contains carved images that were actively stored in the disk (specified by the file system metadata)
   1.6 Embedded in Active:       contains carved images that were embedded in active files

2. Validity
   2.1 Invalid/Partial:          contains invalid/partially carved images
