Sequentially Carved + Entropy Filtering (Threshold: 0.2) - Carved 14 JPEGs in 3.83 s - 0.06 mins

Sequentially Carved + individual Smart Carved images:

- Carve 6  (2 frags) - 6.67   s - 0.11 mins		[iterations: 1691] * the number of iterations performed for recovery	
- Carve 10 (2 frags) - 7.12   s - 0.12 mins		[iterations: 173]	
- Carve 14 (2 frags) - 249.26 s - 4.15 mins		[iterations: 1029]
- Carve 7  (2 frags) - 143.89 s - 2.40 mins 		[iterations: 1516]

Sequentially Carved + Entropy Filtering (Threshold: 0.2) - Carved 102 JPEGs in 6.98 s - 0.12 mins

Note: Maximum number of iteration to recover a JPEG was increased to 20,000 since CARVE 90
requires 16511 iterations in order to be fully-recovered

Sequentially Carved + individual Smart Carved images:

- Carve 86 (2 frags) - 38.70   s - 0.65 mins		[iterations 9882]
- Carve 90 (2 frags) - 1555.44 s - 25.92 mins		[iterations 16511]

Note that CARVE 90 took approximately  26 minutes to be recovered since the sector before the fragmentation point 
was detected incorrectly (delayed by 14 sectors) and a timeout of 20,000 iterations was used for each case.
