- Test set: external/test_sets/disks/nps-2009-canon2-gen6.E01

- Output directory: external/carver_output/results/GEN6(2)

- Scenario: Recovering JPEG files by Sequential Carving + Fragmented Carving

- Fragmented Carving: 6 specific fragmented files were recovered by applying fragmented carving to each
  specific fragmeneted JPEG file. The full recovery process can be performed by invoking the -s a argument, 
  but for for carving speed-up the user is allowed to carve independent files. For this case the 6 successfully
  carved JPEG files can be recovered by the the following arguments.

- Program arguments: 
	1. external/test_sets/disks/nps-2009-canon2-gen6.E01 external/carver_output/results/GEN6 -s carve1
 	2. external/test_sets/disks/nps-2009-canon2-gen6.E01 external/carver_output/results/GEN6 -s carve3
 	3. external/test_sets/disks/nps-2009-canon2-gen6.E01 external/carver_output/results/GEN6 -s carve5
 	4. external/test_sets/disks/nps-2009-canon2-gen6.E01 external/carver_output/results/GEN6 -s carve10
 	5. external/test_sets/disks/nps-2009-canon2-gen6.E01 external/carver_output/results/GEN6 -s carve23
 	6. external/test_sets/disks/nps-2009-canon2-gen6.E01 external/carver_output/results/GEN6 -s carve32

Output structure (automatic generated)

1. corrupted: contains 9 corrupted JPEG files

2. decoded
   2.1 fragmented: contains 8 fragmented/partially-decodable JPEG files
   2.2 recovered: contains 96 fully-recovered JPEG files

3. logs: log files that may be used during the carving process

4. scaled*.jpg: 7 scaled JPEG thumbnail which was used for the proposed Smart-Carving

5. recovered*.jpg: 6 fully-recovered JPEG out of the 8 fragmented files found in 2.1

5. disk_image_temp.raw: is the raw binary data of the corresponding Encase disk image that was
                        automatically generated by the pre-processing module of the prototype JPEG file carver
